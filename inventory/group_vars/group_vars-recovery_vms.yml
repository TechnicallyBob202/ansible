# DNS configuration for recovery VMs
# These servers need DNS pointing to DCs from all domains for forest recovery operations

windows_dns_servers:
  - 192.168.35.20  # KOA-DC (arbor.lab forest root PDC)
  - 192.168.35.30  # GRANITE-DC (alpine.lab forest root PDC)
  - 192.168.35.32  # SLATE-DC (mauna.alpine.lab child domain PDC)
  - 192.168.35.34  # MARBLE-DC (rainier.alpine.lab child domain PDC)

# Recovery VMs remain in workgroup until ADFR recovery process
# They need to resolve ALL forest/domain names during recovery operations
# Windows supports up to 4 DNS servers, so we include:
#   - 1 DC from arbor.lab
#   - 3 DCs from alpine.lab (root + 2 child domains)
