# PRE-PROMOTION DNS CONFIGURATION FOR ALL VMs
# ============================================================================
# This file is used during Stage 02 (configure-base-os) to provide internet 
# connectivity before any domain controllers are promoted.
#
# USAGE:
#   - Rename this file to "all.yml" during Stage 02
#   - After 02-configure completes, rename it back to "all-pre-promo.yml"
#   - This allows the post-promotion DNS files to take effect in Stage 03-04
